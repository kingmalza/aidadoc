API Documentation
==============

Aida integrates the ability to interact with its database through API interface.
Using methods calls like GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, it is possible to interface with external programs or to perform extractions, insertions, table updates directly from code.

Using the link in the main menu "**Schema API**" it will be possible to display the page relative to the published schema of the aida tables, the manageable fields and their type and methods.
