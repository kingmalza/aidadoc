Integration with Jira
-----------------

The aida suite integrates the ability to send the results of every single test finished to Jira, specifying the number of Issues to which you want to refer.
To perform this operation it is sufficient to select the desired thread from the "History" mask, then every single execution (if the test has been performed repeatedly), if the Jira configuration has been set, it will be possible to connect the data between the two systems.

To ensure that the ability to send data to Jira is activated, it is necessary to specify the connection parameters to your Jira server from the "Template Manager" by selecting the "JIRA SETTINGS" option.
