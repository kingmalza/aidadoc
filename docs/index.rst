Create and manage groups
-----------------

In Aida, the group is a grouping of actions that the user associated with that group can perform within the system.
Basically the types of action that can be associated with a group are:

* :bold:'View'
* :bold:'Add/Edit'
* :bold:'Delete'

To define and manage groups in Aida, it is sufficient to use the Templates-> Group Manager menu

   * :bold:'Save and add another' :It saves the data entered, and proposes the same cleaned mask in order to quickly perform a new data    entry. (in some masks, once this option is selected, the system will re-propose some pre-filled fields to guarantee insertion speed)
   * :bold:'Save and continue editing' :Save the entered data and re-propose the mask with the same data inside the various fields present before the saving
