Using Aida as a Test Suite
===========================

Aida is a test suite based on robotframework and selenium that allows you to perform almost any type of test on any environment you want.
To test with Aida you must first create a template that can then be run by different users and with different values from the Aida testing engine.

Once logged in to the system, to go to configure a test you need to use the ** Templates Manager ** link from the main menu:
